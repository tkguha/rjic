  <h2>About the Department of Library & Information Science</h2>
  <p>
    The Department of Library and Information Sciences was established in 1985 with a new approach to Library and Information Science education in the country. 
    The Department introduced for the first time in the country a two-year integrated programme leading to a Master’s degree in Library and Information Science.
    The same pattern of education has now been recommended by the UGC under the Model Curriculum in Library & Information Science in 2002. The University Library 
    is being used as a laboratory for the students for practical training under the guidance of faculty members and practicing librarians. 
    Thus, theory and practice are given equal emphasis through this integrated approach.<br>

    Since 1986, more than 1000 students have already obtained the MLISc degree from the Department, and more than 60 students have been awarded the Ph.D. degree. 
    Many of the students who graduated from this Department are well placed and working in various professional positions in libraries such as University Libraries, 
    College Libraries, State Libraries, R&D Institutes, private sectors, and as lecturers in universities, IIMs, etc.
