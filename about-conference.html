<h2>About the Conference</h2>
<p>
The Ruby Jubilee International Conference aims to critically engage with the multifaceted role of information, knowledge systems, technologies, and libraries in shaping and responding to the complexities of various socio- cultural and academic environments. In an era defined by rapid technological change, growing information needs, and evolving knowledge paradigms, the conference seeks to provide a forum for intellectual exchange, collaboration, and reflection on how these elements intersect and influence one another.
</p>

<p>
A primary objective of the conference is to explore the dynamic role of information in contemporary society; how it is produced, managed, disseminated, and consumed across different contexts. The conference will highlight the growing importance of knowledge systems that go beyond traditional academic frameworks, encompassing both formal  and  informal,  local and global perspectives.

</p>


<p>
The event also seeks to examine the transformative impact of technologies on information access and knowledge sharing. It will provide a platform to discuss digital innovation, emerging tools, and the challenges and opportunities they present for equitable and sustainable information environments.
</p>

<p>
Equally central to the conference is a focus on the role of libraries as evolving institutions that serve as custodians of knowledge, facilitators of lifelong learning, and enablers of informed citizenship. Through this  lens,  the  conference will reflect on how libraries adapt to shifting societal demands while upholding their foundational values of access, inclusivity, and intellectual freedom.
</p>

<p>
Overall, the conference aspires to generate meaningful dialogue around the interconnectedness of information, knowledge systems, technologies, and libraries, and their collective role in fostering resilient, informed, and culturally
responsive societies.
